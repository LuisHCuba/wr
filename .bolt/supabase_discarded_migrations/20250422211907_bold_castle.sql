/*
  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Simplified RLS policies to avoid recursive queries
    - Removed nested SELECT queries in USING/WITH CHECK clauses
    - Added direct role checks using auth.jwt() claims
    - Maintained same security model but with more efficient implementation

  2. Security
    - All tables still have RLS enabled
    - Same access control based on user roles
    - No loss of security, just better implementation
